# Shrutvats-A-Speech-to-Sign-Language
It is a sign language deduction by using python which convert sign lang. to alphabet character
1. Profile of the Problem
Deaf individuals face significant challenges in communication, especially in environments where
sign language is not commonly understood. Similarly, spoken language may be difficult for the
hearing-impaired to understand. While there are tools available that convert text to speech, very
few effective systems address real-time translation between speech and sign language. The need
for a seamless, real-time communication system between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities is crucial in various domains such as education, public services, and healthcare.
2. Profile of the Problem
The Shrutvats project aims to bridge the communication gap between people who use speech and
those who use sign language. The system will convert spoken language into real-time animated
sign language using a virtual character, while also being able to translate sign language gestures
back into speech. This will allow for smoother communication in educational institutions, public
spaces, healthcare settings, and personal conversations.
3. Unique Features in the Project
➢ Real-time conversion of speech into animated sign language using a character.
➢ Translation of sign language gestures back into speech.
➢ Multilingual support for diverse spoken languages and sign languages.
➢ Interactive user interface designed for both the hearing and hearing-impaired.
➢ Compatibility with mobile, desktop, and web platforms.
➢ Machine learning algorithms to improve translation accuracy over time.
